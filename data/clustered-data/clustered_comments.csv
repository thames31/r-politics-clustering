Gaulle E additional distinction from Merrimack Webster One of the many difficulties inherent in creating a dictionary that accurately reflects the language of any large group of people is that these people may not all view certain words and values as equal Nationalism and patriotism present us with an appropriately problematic pair with which to illustrate this Are these words synonymous Is one an insult and the other not Can either of them mean different things to different people Patriotism is the older of the two words with published written evidence dating back to the middle of the 17th century Patriotism came from adding the suffix of ism to the existing word patriot which itself came into English from the French patriote and may be traced back further to the Greek word patrios of one s father There is hardly any judicious man but knoweth that it was neither learning piety nor patriotism that perswaded any of that Nation to Presbytery C N Reasons Why the Supreme Authority of the Three Nations for the time is not in the Parliament 1653 There hath been in London and repairing to it for these many yeers together a knot of Scotish bankers collybists or coinecoursers of traffickers in Merchandise to and againe and of men of other professions who hug all unto themselves that for no respect of vertue honor kinred patriotism or whatever else whereof those quomodocunquizing clusterfists and rapacious varlets have given of late such cannibal like proofs by their inhumanity and obdurate carriage towards some whose shoos strings they are not worthy to unty that were it not that a more able pen then mine will assuredly not faile to jerk them on all sides Thomas Urquhart Ekskybalauron 1652 Quick side note the Urquhart citation above serves two purposes being both our earliest written evidence of the word patriotism and a fine excuse for drawing the reader s attention to the beautifully splenetic turn of phrase quomodocunquizing clusterfists These two words are archaic enough to only be defined in the Oxford English Dictionary which informs us that the former is that makes money in any possible way and the latter is a close fisted or grasping fellow Should you ever find yourself in need of an insult that is not hackneyed and stale we wholeheartedly recommend quomodocunquizing clusterfist End of side note We do not have any evidence of nationalism occurring until just before the 19th century almost a hundred and fifty years after patriotism And in its early use from the end of the 18th century onward for a number of decades nationalism appears to have been largely interchangeable with patriotism with both words primarily being used to refer to a general love of one s country Nationalism must involve the consecrated devotion of a responsive citizenship sound policies must have universal faith and unsound vagaries must have universal condemnation The Marion County News Hamilton AL 1 Jan 1820 Modern France instead of diminishing has if possible encreased this nationalism Removed from his oppression and atrocities they see nothing but the magnificence the success and the splendor of Bonaparte and I assure you that every poor ignorant stupid Creole when he hears of an achievement of this their Demi God evinces a lively interest an exultation as if some choice unlooked for gift of heaven had blessed his family Poulson s American Daily Advertiser Philadelphia PA 11 Oct 1811 If there be not Conservatism and Nationalism and Patriotism enough in the North to rise up and overwhelm with numbers the spirit that points to the the election of anybody but Fremont or of Fremont as the prelude to civil war we had better seek to save as much fratricidal blood as possible in a peaceable line of immediate separation New York Daily News 1 Jul 1856 These two words may have shared a distinct sense in the 19th century but they appear to have grown apart since Or rather it would be more accurate to say that only nationalism has grown apart since the meaning of patriotism has remained largely unchanged There are still obvious areas of overlap we define patriotism as love for or devotion to one s country and nationalism in part as loyalty and devotion to a nation But the definition of nationalism also includes exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or supranational groups This exclusionary aspect is not shared by patriotism A somewhat subtler difference between the two words may be found in their modifiers and the ideas to which each is connected When we examine large bodies of recent text we see that patriotism is more often used in a general sense often in conjunction with such words as bravery valor duty and devotion Nationalism however tends to find itself modified by specific movements most frequently of a political bent ,29
