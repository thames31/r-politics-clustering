121,Patron_of_Wrath,Trump is setting the stage to declare the election invalid done himself as the winner done He will then replace civilian military leadership with hard core loyalists well shit done and finally within the next two months attempt a military MAGA cult army coup And very sadly he s got a good chance of succeeding Either way this is the end of the Republic though I think most of us haven t yet began to realize it ,-63
