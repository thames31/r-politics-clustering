0,Death_By_1000_Cunts,It s ok to be hypocritical when it helps save unborn lives Abortion is responsible for being the leading cause of death year after year Mothers should not be allowed to intentionally and voluntarily kill their innocent and defenseless unborn children without legal consequences just because they don t want to go through with pregnancy,-563
1,mfrager,The original incident was not worth responding to to begin with She should have laughed at him instead she want down to his level and cried about it The guy said an apology who cares His original criticism is just meaningless nonsense He s clearly just a bit jealous that she s attractive and popular So what But she s not striking some moral blow here she s just crying on a soapbox that her feelings got hurt and then hurling her own prosaic insults right back This is now a clown show on both sides is degrading for the institution and is totally in line with the Trump style of politics of endless attacks but never any substance AOC should aim higher ,-390

3,hi_ho_silvers,My point is that all politicians are corrupt Whichever side they pick doesn t matter You have piles of evidence on the GOP I will guarantee there s piles of evidence against the Democrats as well I d suspect roughly 1 1 Just because you belong to one party doesn t mean that party are saints No the GOP isn t saints neither are the democrats For example the democrats all attack trump right now The GOP did the same to Obama People in general can t see past their own convoluted beliefs People in general cannot fathom that there s information out there not necessarily public knowledge that makes irrelevant arguments from both sides of the aisle ,-282

5,DriveThroughLane,Its pretty much the opposite of journalistic integrity You interview a primary source on the record so the people can hear what the administration has to say you don t like what he has to say so you cut him off and then soapbox with one sided arguments of your own after nobody can contradict you You could power a small town by hooking magnets up to the spinning corpse of walter cronkite,-259
6,has-space,Glass houses Biden got five deferments and then claimed he couldn t serve because of a problem that couldn t be proven while you can prove bone problems with x rays Biden claims to jog often so that proves he lied to weasel his way out of serving when he lied and said he couldn t run when he was over fifty years younger ,-257

15,mmmpopsicles,It s so satisfying to see leftist cities with left wing police chiefs left wing mayors left wing city councils and left wing governors call on the national guard to quell their violent leftist adherents Meanwhile concern for these groups spreading COVID goes untouched by the leftist media ,-201
16,billedgerton,The Democrat party mayors of these cities have actively encouraged these riots for months now If they won t stand up to the lawless mobs then it is incumbent upon the federal government to do so ,-201
17,ThisIsBiggy,This is tough for Dems They really want this to turn into a war so they can blame Trump for something but they also don t want a war,-200

26,Yamato863,He was found innocent by the jury of his murder charges after an extensive trial and a smear campaign by the media The prosecution could not provide any hard evidence that he killed or targeted innocent people All they could produce was testimony from a few seals that disliked him because of how he commanded people They could not find any corroborating civilian witnesses the bodies of those innocents alleged to be killed any medical records of any check ins to any hospitals relating to those killings nor could they even say when it took place or where In this country we presume innocence until proven guilty I would argue that taking photos with dead terrorists which was what he was charged with should not be a crime too ,-177

33,DriveThroughLane,The Washinon Post had two civilian eyewitnesses who said Reinoehl opened fire on the US marshals who returned fire They had the US Marshal statement saying Reineohl opened fire first and they returned fire And then they have one supposed eyewitness who is himself linked to the same terrorist group as the gunman who claims he did nothing wrong,-174

101,Malachorn,Fox sucks Having said that the setup was supposed to be impartial and undecideds seemed hard to imagine quite a few of those undecideds were actually undecided and considering voting for Trump And Stephanopoulos is a good moderator but there was a fair amount of confrontation between candidate and host that didn t really help the tone either So I can sorta see it Fox blatantly lies and throws out paranoid rhetoric that is completely basis They almost have a point here though and this kinda accusation doesn t even compare to much worse they ve done in past Of course the idea of trying to find people genuinely sitting on the fence with Trump was maybe an impossible task Trump is VERY divisive So if we really are trying to be perfectly fair the town hall didn t deliver terribly well with the proposed format but it was probably about as good of an attempt as possible to deliver on such a format all things considered which sorta says A LOT about where we are as a country in Trump s America ,-134

149,super_ag,This is why nobody trust politcal hack media outlets like the HuffPo Trump didn t blame Biden for not instituting a mask mandate He said the Democrats who currently control the House said they were going to institute a mask mandate which they haven t done Trump was asked Why don t you support a mask mandate and why don t you wear one more often And his answer was Well I do wear them when I have to and when I m in hospitals and other locations but I will say this They said at the Democrat convention they re going to do a national mandate They never did it because they ve checked out and they didn t do it And a good question is you ask why Joe Biden they said we re going to do a national mandate on masks Is this a good answer Not really I think he was trying to say that even the Democrats who are for mask mandates looked into doing one and found out they couldn t do it I ll give an analogy Let s say he was asked Why haven t you implemented universal healthcare for all And Trump said They looked into doing that in California They realized it would cost more than they could afford so they didn t do it Is he blaming California legislators for not having a Federal Universal Healthcare plan No He s pointing to a group who claimed support for something but realized they couldn t do it and so they didn t He clumsily did this with this woman s question But rather than trying to figure out what he meant political hacks like Nick Vasser take that quote and say Trump is blaming Biden who isn t President for not instituting a mask mandate That s not what he did He didn t say The reason there s not a mask mandate is because it s Biden s fault ,-116

1123,bitfriend6,If you fail to understand why Putin got elected you re never going to understand why he s able to command Russia as he does Same for China Making him into a boogeyman avoids any serious inspection of Russian policy beyond they do bad things This is a person who took a failed state a failed state the west helped create and turned it into a stable economic superpower He is doing something right in the sense that the average Russian today is better off than they were a generation ago This has staying power You cannot say the same about the average American who has seen their wealth and purchasing power trickle away This has been the defining characteristic of the past three Presidential elections While Russia is strong stable and growing under Putin the west is increasingly unable to convince a frayed middle class that the economic sacrifices they make for liberalism is worth it A failure to deal with this and the difficult questions it forces is ceding the future to Russia and China ,-20

1135,ArrantSway,Well it kind of makes sense The vast majority of cases whether you like it or not are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms It s not right to force an employer to give paid sick leave for two weeks for someone that can taste their sandwich and has a headache Oh and 10 weeks of paid family leave What the hell This single act alone could bankrupt almost any company This is insane The government should pay their wages during that time if they are going to force small businesses to do that ,-19

1394,profzoff,If any constitutional lawyers would like to chime in otherwise it s clear y all don t know what you re talking about After Nixon s presidency Congress created the Presidential Records Act of 1978 out of concern that former President Nixon would destroy the tapes that led to his resignation and those of future presidents This hasn t been an issue since GWB and now Trump The PRA78 sets strict rules for presidential records created during a president s term They include material related to constitutional statutory or other official or ceremonial duties of the President This includes records created on electronic platforms later clarified in 2014 to include email Facebook Twitter and YouTube Narrow exceptions exist for things like diaries journals or other personal notes that don t need to be opened for review unless directly tied to criminal acts or proceedings Omorosa was at the center point of one of these controversies with the administration being accused of improperly disposing of email servers Under the law revised in as part of The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 the federal government must maintain ownership and control of all presidential records including records created by the president s staff Once a president leaves office all presidential records must be transferred to the archivist of the United States who makes them available to the public over time Trump administration has not worked with David Ferriero the US archivist to establish these protocols thus needing to work with Twitter directly AND THIS IS WHY TWITTER CONTINUES TO GIVE TRUMP A PLATFORM The law passed to modernize the PRA with respect to electronic records provides that the president should not use an unofficial electronic messaging account for presidential records unless he or she copies or forwards a complete copy to an official account TRUMP HAS NOT While there is no specific language regarding social media past presidents set up auto archiving so that deleted tweets were also saved TRUMP HAS NOT Trump administration regularly has rebuked working with Twitter to do this very thing thus Twitter as an American corporation has a responsibility to maintain the public record since Trump isn t complying with either the 1978 nor the 2014 laws Trump can sue Twitter which the administration has done and lost Thus again Twitter is responsible to the public records act to continue providing that platform so that the courts can review whether any given piece of information should be categorized as a presidential record or not But the president has control over creation management and disposal decisions after that initial categorization assuming they have permission of the archivist TRUMP DOES NOT This is NOW Twitter s role in the absence of coordination with the Trump administration ,-2
1395,Seathttrail,This is complicated but I will try via phone First there is Rolodexing The DNC will not back a candidate unless they have phone numbers of high donors on their phones We are talking million of dollars The DNC will rather back a candidate that has connections to wealth rather than connections to the people This is why they have terrible candidates Money always wins Don t fool yourself DNC will always have votes they can pick and choose their voters like the GOP Gerrymandering is here to stay Neither party will get rid of it Next is everything is negotiable people don t understand this When they are behind closed doors they are discussing optics as well as messaging The DNC and the GOP are well coordinated Controversy is money The DNC could have stopped the Supreme Court Nomination They had over 15 different ways to do so They didn t The controversy gave them money Plus now with a conservative court there will be more controversy and they can blame their failures on the Supreme Court The DNC didn t care about the nomination They wanted it And I said this before Biden is already on record telling his donors that nothing will fundamentally change Those with money will have open door access to the President Just look at his cabinet dripping with lobbyist and he went out of his way to shut the door on every progressive idea Next two years the rich will get richer and the DNC won t care about losing in 2022 because they are making bank ,-2

1611,dunkintitties,They ve been so successful with pushing their narrative because the people lapping it up are really fucking dumb I would say about 85 of the Republican voterbase was already perfectly primed for indoctrination into the Trump cult by a combination of religion racism and poor education willful ignorance A lack of critical thinking skills plays a big role as does at the risk of offending religion Religion is particularly good at just perfectly priming people for indoctrination into extremist movements like QAnon Trumpism Combining all of those things typically produces a person who thinks that belief opinion is just as important and logically valid and as objective scientific fact The framework they have for evaluating the truthfulness of a claim is based on that belief If an unverified or impossible to verify claim makes them feel good sounds right and reinforces their worldview then that claim becomes The Truth in their minds Evidence or lack thereof doesn t factor into the decision to immediately adopt something as reality Burden of proof is a foreign concept to them and they re not interested in learning what is It wouldn t matter even if they did want to see proof because they don t understand how to evaluate its quality This Is pretty apparent when they present dubious or entirely fabricated evidence to people they ve hoping to indoctrinate into the Trump Qult TL DR Ignorance racism and religion in combination stunt the ability to separate truth from falsehood and thus create a person who s incredibly easy to manipulate into believing whatever you want them to believe ,1

1748,gir_loves_waffles,I m a shutdown the people who feel that pinch the most aren t the agencies but the individuals who work for those agencies They re forced to work but with suspended pay Not just politicians not host people making six figures but the janitors and support staff too people who live paycheck to paycheck They should not be forced to pay the brunt of our collective ineptitude every year ,1
1749,renwoman1127,So beyond the whole COVID conga line with no masks if and that s a huge if that doesn t disgust you then the mere fact that they are holding fancy expensive parties while millions of people are struggling to just put food on their table should show just how tone deaf they really are This whole thing is wrong on so many levels ,1
1750,IntermittentDrops,The 600 stimulus checks are 20 of the bill but are taking up 90 of the attention The big story is actually the return of the Unemployment Insurance subsidies which were hugely important in reducing poverty and which Republicans refused to extend until this package If you look at you can see it actually increased by 10 That s despite a 9 decrease in GDP That was due in large part to the increase to unemployment benefits which brought many recipients to over 100 of their pre unemployment earnings This time it s less generous 85 but it s really important that Congress finally resumed the program They should never have let it lapse and you can blame Mitch McConnell for that Overall the US unleashed a 3 3 trillion cash bazooka as part of its fiscal response and totaling 15 of GDP It s really hard to overstate how massive that is aren t in poverty right now because of these stimulus packages The poverty level is projected to be roughly what it was pre COVID which is kind of mind boggling considering how much of the economy was shut down ,1

1752,sunlightFTW,Sorry I replied from my inbox without reading in context I have no idea how many dead people voted which way I do believe many human beings are dishonest and fraud likely occurred on both sides as it probably does in every election but not nearly enough to change the result I thought you were testing whether I thought the result should be overturned My original comment is at 62 as of right now That s at least 63 people who can t handle a rational comment that doesn t support either party Tribalism is a hard habit to break ,1

1757,Tonguesten,literally nobody thinks this relief bill is a victory its democrats acquiescing to amoral republicans it s a defeat it s a show of weakness and the worst part is that it was a necessary defeat so that the democrats could give SOMETHING to the working people so that the country can continue to pretend like feeding the rich and starving the poor is going to save them this sickening political situaion in D C really makes me want to wish that COVID was more deadly more virulent and more untreatable because then at least there would most certainly have been less wasted time less deaths and more proactive action to make this pandemic a lot less drawn out and painful than it is ,1

1800,akcrono, Yeah like the 2008 bailout where numerous Americans lost their homes while the 1 bought up that free real estate None of that was the bailout Or this past bailout where we are now having our fellow Americans evicted and unemployed in massive numbers which is why we re even doing this stimulus to begin with None of that was the bailout Yeah the wealth gap between the wealthiest Americans and the average ones is totally getting smaller whole the top 0 1 has enriched themselves to the tune of hundreds of billions with this pandemic What a weird straw man argument that I never made Just straight lies you re trying to sell us man Two examples that make it clear you don t know what a bailout is and a straw man argument and I m a liar now How do you take yourself seriously ,1

2052,anonymous_potato,For one thing you can make the punishment for interfering worse than the benefit The Russian interference story would have been dropped shortly after the election if Trump strongly condemned it immediately implemented sanctions and took a hardline anti Russian stance Instead Trump spent the past 4 years praising Russia lobbying for them to be readmitted to the G7 giving them the benefit of the doubt at every opportunity and delaying sanctions passed by Congress for as long as possible Not to mention he gave them a gift by alienating allies and pulling out of the Open Skies treaty Russia was well rewarded for their efforts ,1

2134,FANGO,You should probably also note that for the entirety of that time period Democrats have gotten more votes in the Senate and the Presidency given the fake incumbency bonus the loser of the 2000 election got and the imposition of untraceable electronic voting I don t really count the 2004 election but if you want to give them 4 out of the last 28 years fine and also for much longer than 380 days in the House And yet for some reason we still let the minority party the loser republicans have their say Why do we keep listening to incompetent violent losers ,1

2137,steve2306,It s not treason if it s a rigged election son One day you ll see that ,1
2138,GeorgioArmani2238,Then there s a chance it may be coincidental then I would say however that just because the move had the backing of the international community this doesn t necessarily exclude the fact that Biden s primary motivation to strong arm the Ukraine Administration was personal I haven t seen any evidence that this was purely the work of the State Department If that was the case I see absolutely no reason why the VP would need to be involved That would be a matter for the Secretary of State You make a good point and it s something that I m aware of But it doesn t explain Biden s active involvement in this case nor does it demonstrate that the VP s motive was not to benefit personally from the move You can simultaneously make a move that is perceived as good for the international community and pursue it for selfish reasons Which would still constitute a breach of the Emoluments clause if so ,1

2141,GrandAdmiralSnackbar,Not saying you re wrong but what do you think if you read this article Before I read it I was more agreeing with you but if the figures quoted there are true it does look fishy ,1
2142,ProgNose,The second one not so much Trump had inherited enough wars to spread his mayhem In his term more drone strikes were conducted than in Obama s two terms While the US was already involved in Syria once he took office the bombs became more and biger And let s not forget how much he tried starting a war with Iran ,1
2143,FreydisTit,Art deco Like the Bonwit Teller building he demolished to build a skyscraper ,1
2144,yellowcloak,Similar story though I dropped out of the party in 2014 Officially anyways ,1
2145,Sythic_,Point is they didn t and it will never go to a hospital now that they are already there Her dose is waiting for her in a freezer at the capitol and passing up on it isn t going to get it back onto a truck and delivered to a hospital worker The logistics contract is already paid and complete for this particular dose It s such a small amount regardless We re talking about 20m doses in the next few months Its a rounding error to get them over with and hopefully back to work for us thats a whole other thing of course but hypothetically thats what should happen ,1
2146,dragoninmysoup,That s very true,1
2147,LPQ_Master,Yeah that s that I was trying to ask So for example if I made 50k in a year and the tax I owed was 7000 random numbers Could I just bring a client out to lunch everyday until I have enough receipts to equate 7000 Yes technically I spent 7k on lunches over the year but now I owe 0 tax I m not sure if you can even write off all your taxable income But still seems crazy beneficial only for the CEOs etc Where the little guy doesn t get anything ,1
2148,Gone213,I hope they go to court because these right wing news sources aren t doing as much to redeem the company in the eyes of the public as the papers should have Then I hope once they do go to court the voting machine companies ask the judge to force these news channels to air 1 hour every 4 hours for 2 weeks that they were wrong If not then the lawsuit resumes with damages 10 fold ,1
2149,Jetberry,Yep and literally yesterday in this sub people were praising AOC for taking the vaccine ,1
2150,GumdropGoober,CDC says There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID 19 again this is called natural immunity Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID 19 may not last very long but more studies are needed to better understand this Until we have a vaccine available and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations to CDC on how to best use COVID 19 vaccines CDC cannot comment on whether people who had COVID 19 should get a COVID 19 vaccine So it seems safest to give him the vaccine either way ,1
2151,MaximumEffort433, To me this it makes sense that all of these not for profit offices could become bloated because people will want a system to stagnate as soon as they re put in office Are we talking about the intelligence agencies I mean I m a Democrat when people say Tax and spend my eyes tear up with glee so the idea of bloated budgets and bloated agencies doesn t bother me as much as the alternative Look at the IRS they barely have the budget to scrape by and as a result they are less able to enforce tax law and because wealthy people are more expensive to investigate and prosecute it s the little guy who gets the audits Like if we could agree on We should make a greater effort to balance freedom and security I d be down with that I m always down with having that discussion But They re too big isn t an argument that I find compelling Sorry not like trying to dismiss your point or anything But it just doesn t mean as much to me as it does to you If we started making indiscriminate cuts we risk sacrificing knowledge of things like pedophile rings or election integrity or this big ass hack from overseas Very very discriminate cuts might be okay but when it comes to cutting budgets or taxes I d rather use a scalpel than a machete This may make you cringe but if the federal government knowing my browsing history somehow makes it less likely that I ll be killed being shot in an alt right coup attempt then I m okay with the FBI knowing what porn I watch I use a VPN anyway It s a shitty shitty trade but Sorry friend bloated government bureaucracy just sounds like another way of saying well paying government jobs to me ,1
2152,ExiledDuckling,Why wouldn t they be more important though There s relatively few of them so it s not really a giant operation to get them vaccinated and just a couple getting sick is a threat to the entire US national security People in congress get extra protection all the time and we don t call that a form of inequality ,1

2157,Peter_Abelard2,It s a pointless gesture She is denying no one Once it is delivered to a location It needs special refrigeration and handling and quick use If the doses are where she gets her primary health care or a vaccination station just get it A lot of the vaccine will go to waste more will get manufactured The problem is distribution ,1

2165,mountainducky,Lock him up,1
2166,Sattorin, One person one vote is the only fair way to choose a singular individual who represents Americans in an executive capacity The vast majority of representative democracies don t directly elect their heads of state The circumstances of the US are very different from most other representative democracies most of which by the way don t directly elect their heads of government These days countries don t tend to take the authoritarian position of ignoring a popular vote for secession and once one State does staying in the country becomes even less attractive for those that remain ,1

2174,Russelsteapot42,I ve said for a while that my response to people asking what Trump should have done is He should have put on a fucking American flag mask somewhere between March and April and said it s debatable whether the law can require it but I consider it every American s patriotic duty to do what s necessary to stop the spread of this China virus They should never have let it out but now it s here and we ve got to do what we have to to keep this deadly virus under control He wouldn t even have had to executive order anything and his cult absolutely would have followed him If only we d elected a leader rather than a two bit dictator ,1

2176,ILikeCutePuppies,You are right They are claiming that this is almost the exact bill they offered Pelosi months ago and that she admitted that she was blocking it due to the election It is a very distorted view but republicans want to believe that the GOP is on their side so they will believe it ,1

2188,Adseg5,As a 30 something that has lost a friend overseas I guess I m just not too enthusiastic about setting ourselves up against arguably one of the few countries that could put up a fight against our military But you re certainly right that the invasion of Ukraine was uncalled for and wars have been started over less than that ,1

2201,apostledeets,It comes down to timing Elected public servicants should be ranked under essential workers but before the general population The appropriate time IMO for Congress to take the vaccine is roughly 3 4 weeks before it is available for general population distribution ,1

2204,adtechheck,I don t give a fuck about the right Take your vaccine protect yourself first,1
2205,local_reddit_user,I m repeating my comment to you as I m interested to hear your take I m of the view that virtuous actions are good However virtue signalling is an inherintly pejorative term and means a disingenuous expression of moral values with the intent to enhance one s own image The way I see it it might be virtuous if Illhan Ohmar gave up her vaccine to someone who needs it more That s not what is actually happening though the vaccine she was earmarked to get is not now going to suddenly go to a doctor or healthcare worker and her refusing to take it is not going to make doctors or healthcare workers get vaccinated any quicker Her action is not actually virtuous and doesn t change anything it just signals a percieved virtue ie selflessness Actually getting the vaccine would do more good as it might help reduce the spread of COVID ,1
2206,SimonBakerIsDaddy,I m from Oregon and the thumbnail pic is too accurate for south eastern Oregonians,1
2207,OwsaBowsa, Frontline workers are typically those in healthcare Essential is the broader term for everyone expected or allowed to work during the pandemic like those in restaurants or grocery stores It s important to note the distinction for the sake of what she wrote Plus many aspects of Omar s job can be done remotely or at a significant distance from her colleagues It s not exactly grandstanding to say those in regular contact with Covid for days weeks months and soon to be years on end should receive the treatment even before lawmakers ,1

2221,Kogana,get out of here with that both sides crap We could have universal healthcare right now I mean lets truth dawg pound After World War II the US had 55 of the world s industrial capacity That went away and so to a certain extent American anger at the declining standards of living is pretty ridiculous in a historical context Add to that automation and the ravaging effects of climate and environmental destruction there is just plain less to go around on top of a declining need for extra mouths Capitalism just ain t the answer and Americans are just stamping their feet in tantrums cuz of it Both parties bullshit Get out of here with that ,1

2228,Imadethistosaythis19,Ya I guess things like this are only news when the vast majority of fraud or mistakes favor one candidate and they are potentially enough to swing results in certain counties Which what they believe Everyone assumes fraud happens every election It s ironic comment though because the news that is given thought or time in this sub is the most selective I ve ever seen ,1

2232,LegendaryWarriorPoet,It s a little unclear what you mean by write that off on income tax but basically you get to deduct that from the income that you are taxed on not from your tax bill So say your tax rate is 30 it basically means that 30 of that lunch is free to you because if it hadnt been deducted from your income you would have paid 30 tax on that 100 of income ,1
2233,HarshmallowsRS,You re right those doses should have gone to hospitals however now that they already have been earmarked for congress the chances of it going to a hospital are slim Most likely what will happen is that it will sit around until she decides to take it since it s easier to have it in waiting than to source another dose when she does want to take it ,1

2285,FloofyFurryDude,I don t mean to be an Right wing coot but don t most of these surveys have major left leaning bias By that I mean don t most participates come from dense urban cities where Democrats are far more common Also I think that like 80 of republicans don t respond to these surveys ,1
2286,__theoneandonly,Trump was given an experimental treatment where essentially they pump donated antibodies into your blood and in theory those antibodies fight the infection for you Insanely oversimplified Now here s the rub If that treatment works it s still experimental then it s possible that his body may not have had time to figure out how to build its own antibodies Which means that if he comes into contact with COVID 19 again his immunity may not be as strong enough to fight off reinfection Having the vaccine proper would make sure that his immune system was fully equipped to deal with the virus should he come in contact again ,1

2288,local_reddit_user,I think you are confusing what virtue signaling means Virtuous actions are good Virtue signalling is an inherintly pejorative term and means a disingenuous expression of moral values with the intent to enhance one s own image The way I see it it might be virtuous if Illhan Ohmar gave up her vaccine to someone who needs it more That s not what is actually happening though the vaccine she was earmarked to get is not now going to suddenly go to a doctor or healthcare worker and her refusing to take it is not going to make doctors or healthcare workers get vaccinated any quicker Her action is not actually virtuous and doesn t change anything it just signals a percieved virtue ie selflessness Actually getting the vaccine would do more good as it might help reduce the spread of COVID ,1

2294,Polohorsesnpiff,I love how in their two minute clarification video I guess they try to put the blame on the various guests who offered their opinion Well who is the one who gave those people air time Who didn t question them for hard evidence yet entertained the idea of massive voter fraud which caused Trump to lose the election While almost EVERY court in MULTIPLE states over 50 harshly dismissed the claims of fraud being argued by Trumps lawyers Some were Trump spouted judges and then the Supreme Court with THREE Trump appointed judges itself denied taking up the two cases his lawyers put before them And now they re AGAIN asking the Supreme Court to reverse multiple Pennsylvania election court decisions for what is beyond me because even with their 20 electoral votes he still loses the election To finally prove his fraud probably good luck Anyways Newsmax OAN and FOX all continued to let these people on the news and publicly argue their case Of course that worked cause the viewers believe this is REAL news and everything is now just a fake news liberal conspiracy that Biden got elected or some bullshit But I hope they all get sued They deserve it and if it brings them down and off the air then all the better Then we need to demand that our news reports facts and has journalistic integrity again The lawyer goes on to say Fox persuasively argues that given Mr Carlson s reputation any reasonable viewer arrive s with an appropriate amount of skepticism about the statement he makes Ya except that is NOT what happens People believe the narratives those networks push are the truth and ONLY truth That s absolutely TOXIC for our country and they all deserve to be sued out of existence at the very least It was the reporting on Newsmax OAN and FOX that legitimized these claims for millions of viewers It wasn t some troll online saying it this time but the news that was spreading these false narratives No one should believe Trump won besides Trump himself whining about losing like he predictably would Continuing to defend any of Trump s lawyers claims despite the lack of any real evidence that supported them is absolutely despicable So fuck all these news networks who have been pushing Trumps false claims his whole presidency I hope you all get sued by these voting machine companies and lose And with what their recent ass kissing of Trump s fraud claims has gotten some viewers to believe they deserve to get criminally charged with sedition ,1

2344,BD401,There s a kind of damned if you do damned if you don t conundrum for politicians on taking the vaccine at the first opportunity I ve thought about it and I would err on the side that politicians and other influential individuals should take it at the first chance they get and heavily promote pictures of them taking it in the media and their social feeds They ll be accused of jumping the line yes But I think the public health interest of normalizing the vaccines and dissuading conspiracy theories about them outweighs the queue jumping optics some people may have Substantively a few hundred doses going to politicians first won t even register from a supply perspective But it WILL go a long way to boosting public confidence and acceptance of a vaccine So in this example I certainly appreciate her sentiment but I think it s more likely to do harm than good ,1

2412,gingerfawx,Going out on a limb I m going to say anyone who thinks the appropriate response to losing an election might be martial law is probably an authoritarian I m not a history buff but I don t think we ve ever seen a clearer example of one in that position The way he used customs and border control to try and quash the BLM protests Ffs The number of EOs he used the end runs around getting approval for his appointees He has repeatedly shown he doesn t feel the president should be checked in his decision making Or at least as long as the president is Trump If it s Obama then one must tweet about the brazenness endlessly I ll definitely give you the point on his pandemic response though I think the answer is he isn t just an authoritarian First and foremost I think he s in it for profit power and prestige He s loath to give others credit Putin is fine of course but Nancy or any other female dem is just a nasty woman if the opposition says the virus is a serious threat he seems pathologically unable to agree And judging by everything he did his first and ruling thought was how do we monetize this He talks about the markets all the time When does he speak about dead The only damage he sees is fiscal not human and even then he can t fake anything that passes for sympathy So Malignant narcissist Greedy capitalist Probably a sociopath or whatever the current term for them is But with definite authoritarian leanings ,1

2501,Astormi,Abolishing the electoral college would actually benefit both Republicans and Democrats Throw in 2 or 3 other parties while you re at it and hear me out for my reasoning I would argue that the the majority of a country usually isn t radical In American politics right now we see Republicans going extreme right and democrats going more left I don t consider universal healthcare to be extreme left ideology The question is why is that happening Well because the GOP can appeal to the minority of voters and still win If we take a look at germany we see that the CDU Centrist right party with Angela Merkel as their head won the election the last decade More extreme parties like the AFD Right wing party and Die Linke Left wing party usually stay under 10 of total votes Centrist are more likely to get votes The only thing that has changed is that Die Grünen Left leaning environmentalist party has gotten lots of traction lately and I would argue that the reason for that is that it s urgent to fight climate change now That being said both parties would be forced to be more Centrist again to appeal to the majority of Americans thus making them less extreme ,1
2502,ReheatedTacoBell,That s fair I reread it and I could have made it clearer I am saltily complaining that not having laws regarding truthful reporting should already be in place to deter this behavior of misinformation from right wing news organisations rather than them being able to put the misinformation out there for public consumption and then walk it back only after lawyers are involved Basically if there were laws about this Fox Newsmax etc likely would have at least had a more difficult time spreading their garbage everywhere Per usual though afaik to the displeasure of Congress ,1

2606,buyfreemoneynow,I think you re off by 50 and there is a 100 chance that closed source voting machines made by private companies owned by major party patrons donors are compromised There have been far too many inconsistencies with exit polling and general polling as well as last second localized catastrophes since these things were rolled out State BOE leaders are wined and dined and flown around in private jets before they decide to spend millions to procure overpriced voting machines that have bare minimum auditing standards and are stored in warehouses with lax security up until and including the days they are used I ve been following this issue for nearly 20 years I was a coder in high school and college and after watching the Republicans steal Florida in my first election in 2000 automatically gave me pause when these things started rolling out What pisses me off the most is that Trump had to be the first politician to call them out after they have been flipping votes for nearly two decades There is so much documentation out there regarding nearly everything I have said so far My funspiracy thinking means I have zero faith in our voting process as long as we have these machines and I do think the 2020 election was rigged af to get rid of Trump and keep Congress in gridlock because the markets and the oligarchs love when everyone hates Congress and they can step in for a heroic moment or two or just hide behind the curtains and dodge paying their taxes ,1

2641,Bnasty5,Not going to lie but your entire argument is nonsense There is no mutual understand for complete falsehoods This isnt just opposing politics this is people refusing to see the grass is green and arguing its blue and if they say something thats is objectively wrong or their belief isnt grounded in reality or reasoning then of course agreement or argument is the only option I feel you dont understand the actual stakes here when half the country wont accept basic truths For instance trump raised taxes on everyone making under 75k in the long run starting in 22 those people would see their taxes increase and increase every 2 years until 2027 That is a civic engagment that isnt in contention Thats how the bill works if someone is arguing that trump is all about lowering taxes then im suppose to just say you know what your opinion is objectively wrong but i respect it and you ,1
2642,Misnome5,but did nothing on immigration reform abortion and gun control for example I m genuinely curious is this because of the possibility that the dems could have filibustered their more extreme ideas from passing senate Cause if that s the case I think that would be a pretty good argument to keep the filibuster even if the GOP does use it in frustrating ways ,1

3146,mukster,Couldn t their defense be that those were the counties with the most votes for Biden thus more suspicious and they just happen to have a larger black population Were there whiter counties of similar size that went for Biden in similar numbers that were not challenged which could be used as evidence that Blacker counties were specifically targeted as opposed to just heavily Democratic counties ,1

3149,dontcommentonmyname,This is a good writeup The unfortunate reality is that not every job is going to make sense from the companies perspective to pay more than 30k year 15 hour is part of the democratic platform for what a minimum wage should be If you cannot make it on 30k per year at the lifestyle in your example then that is when food stamps and living with roommates have to become a factor I have always advocated for their being some kind of minimum government safety net whether it be a UBI or targeted welfare I don t think you can push the blame on Amazon They are a business trying to make money and they still have people lining up to take jobs paying 15 hr At 20 hr there is no guarantee they would offer the same amount of jobs at 15 ,1

3170,ZaDu25, The bombs were not dropped for political or religious purposes War is inherently political you d have to literally consider any act of war terrorism Non collateral attacks against non combatants is terrorism by definition Attacks on combatants soldiers don t fit that definition Firebombing a missile factor would be terrorism if civilians worked there That s kind of a separate discussion tho The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not attacks on specific military production facilities bases That s when it becomes terrorism once again despite the fact that not dropping the bombs would have resulted in more casualties on both sides Even if you want to make this argument Which as far as I m concerned is no more than speculation as there may have been other measures for all we know at play to end the war without bombing two cities flat with nukes None of this disputes the fact that the bombings fit the definition of terrorism either way ,1

3177,PlayingtheDrums, Another commenter brought up leagues based on weight class This has a massive downside Big people get an advantage is some sports linebacking for example short people get advatage in other sports winger in soccer for example In rowing once there was no weight category big women with large muscles would generally win in the women s category Then they seperated by weight and instead of small people getting their own category very soon as you would expect this category was full of people who were good at rowing but not quite as good as the best but who were also very good at dieting It s easy to see in fighting sports the people in lower weightclasses tend to be extremely dry and lean People in higher weightclasses tend to look much healthier I think it s important to accept that some sports favor bigger people just as other sports favor smaller people ,1

3203,FeelsGoodMan2,I m confused though if the republicans are far right and currently in power and the democrats need to shift right to win back power then aren t you just admitting that in order to get policy passed in america you have to lean to the right Like would people prefer a party that goes all in progressive and bangs their chest and never gets anything passed over a 50 year period because they never have any seats I m fairly progressive myself but I also recognize that american voters in general are regressive as hell Even some of the ones that vote democrat fairly reliably are far closer to republican than they are to me We can t keep hoping for moral victories as the country burns down Sometimes you have to work with the second best option rather than the worst option That s how game theory works after all ,1

3235,East_ByGod_Kentucky,Are you saying that his lifetime of experience as a political leader in the Latin American community doesn t lend him enough credibility to at least consider his comments on why Latinos voted the way they did in the most recent election Once again I have committed to changing my view if the data proves me wrong Will you commit to the same I think that s a fair question Because there are also concerns among many in the party that those of us who are further left are no different than the far right in an unwillingness to expand our thinking about the party s message I d really like to prove them wrong whenever I get the opportunity I am proudly in favor of Medicare for All decriminalization of all drugs reforming policing universal student loan forgiveness the right to strike and the importance of labor unions doubling the salaries of teachers and doubling the numbers of them in classrooms completely overhauling our infrastructure especially to provide free broadband to every person in this country and I want to do it all by decreasing military spending raising taxes on the rich and ending corporate welfare I want every American to be free to love and marry whoever they want and enjoy the same freedoms and justice and equal protection regardless of gender I believe in the reproductive autonomy of women I want election reform that creates universal voter registration and vote by mail I believe we should grant full immediate amnesty to every undocumented worker in the country strenhen border security and streamline the legal immigration process I also understand that the path to accomplishing those things has to begin somewhere and the very first step is being honest about where the majority of the country stands on those issues understanding why they hold their views and beginning the long work of accomplishing something we can point to as proof that our way works Unfortunately not every district is like AOC s It s a big country and Democrats haven t done a great job of reaching out to the very people we need to show up and vote for us You ll get no argument from me there But I also refuse to block out the things I don t want to hear about the efficacy of my strategies I can t actually learn anything by doing that Which is why I m perfectly willing to admit I may be wrong about the negative electoral impact of far left messaging in Florida But from the information I have available it seems to be the most logical explanation for now anyway ,1

3359,shutz2,I m more and more of the opinion that instead of forcing kids to adapt to school school should be better at adapting to the various kids And this is coming from someone who did really well in school and only started getting some real academic challenges in college But it shouldn t just be about making it easy for everybody School should be challenging It should be about finding the optimal level of challenge that keeps the kids interested and feeling like they re accomplishing things and seeing their hard work pay off And that includes challenging the ones who do well too Not to mention kids will find some subjects easier than others So it s about finding alternative ways to get them to learn the subjects they find harder while keeping them motivated to push forwards on their easier subjects instead of just coasting along If a kid learns better in a traditional lecture format have some more of that If a kid learns better in front of a computer at their own pace have some more of that If a kid learns better by doing pen and paper exercises have some more of that And so on But make sure kids are exposed to all forms of learning and occasionally force them through the methods that don t work as well as a punctual challenge to get through so that they ll be prepared in the future if faced with that form of learning All of this would require more investment in the educational system mainly to hire more teachers and pay them more so you get people who actually want to be there instead of those who are stuck with no other options so you can have smaller groups You can balance that out by having the lecture type occur in front of larger groups when it makes sense as long as the kids then get to go to a smaller group for the alternative methods It s important to set a baseline as a society for what we want children to know once they come out of school but it s equally as important to make sure that we have the tools to make sure they can all learn this And maybe one more thing while I agree that school can be a major source of social anxiety for many I feel that it s still important that all children go through a social environment as learning to interact in society should be one of those important things all children should learn The major causes of this anxiety need to be identified and addressed but this should still remain one of the challenges all kids should face But in the end there are 3 central things that all children should come out of school with to the point where showing a distinct lack in any of those should almost be a failure point but at the same time these are the things school should work the hardest to make sure all kids get to a minimum acceptable level 1 Logic and rational thought this includes understanding the basics of logic the ability to recognize logical fallacies and the ability for deductive and inductive reasoning Some basics in philosophy shouldn t be about remembering the all the names and dates should be about learning to think 2 Creativity and imagination this is something most kids start out with School should never try to suppress this it should encourage it This is one of the things that leaves many kids feeling stifled in school I can already hear the teachers objecting We re gonna lose control of our classes It ll be chaos Well there needs to be a way to structure things so that kids feel they always have an outlet for their creativity but that occasionally they have to control it That s why starting early with logic and rational thought can help a lot If all kids have a basis there they should be easier to reason with 3 Empathy it seems to me that all problems suffering in human society can be traced back to a lack of empathy Kids who show a distinct lack of empathy need to be caught early so it can be addressed before they become full fledged sociopaths and if this is the sort of thing you re born as these kids need to be caught early and treated More empathy would reduce bullying and it would actually make the teachers jobs easier The ability to see things from another s point of view makes you a lot more receptive to learning in general too It makes you want to learn about others If a kid comes out of school with these 3 most important things I guarantee you they will also have learned more things in school From my point of view having all 3 creates a kid who s much less likely to ask about subjects they re less interested in This is a waste of my time When am I ever going to use this turning it into curiosity a combination of 1 and 3 and maybe they ll also have enough imagination to see how they will use what they learn ,1

4009,agree-with-me,No you go after it You don t just vote because that s what they give you My old man said there will be no revolution until you go and take the Cadillac out of the rich man s driveway He won t give it to you BTW I listened to him went after it and worked my ass off As a union member I became political started a PAC and was directly responsible for getting numerous State and local liberal candidates elected The PAC I started has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars All given to liberals I beleive in unabashed liberalism and don t apologize for it But you gotta want it too Think I could get some younger guys to knock on doors or do a lit drop or even some phone banking Crickets Seeing where this would eventually get me I kept at it and moonlighted to start and run a successful business that pays union equivalent wages and benefits of course even with my career If you want to go fishing or sit on your couch instead of electing and supporting people that will actually put up a fight have no expectations then So I guess vote away on these stupid bills By all means take what The Man graciously offered you The 600 ain t going to do squat for anyone but I ll take the check The saddest thing about all of this is I ll probably make more on the tax breaks than the cash offer You feel that anger welling up inside you Well don t get angry at me go after the fucker that keeps writing and passing these bills Go get your Cadillac But stay liberal Pony Boy Stay liberal ,1

4011,FlyingDutchman34,Actually I think it s very likely Biden will be sworn in Not because he deserves it but because fraud is just super difficult to prove The only delusion comes from the denial that shady shit happened on November 3rd Not letting watchers actually watch telling people to go home then counting hidden boxes hundreds of affidavits saying things like they were told to back date ballots or ballots were unfolded even though they were sent in the mail or ballots that were returned the same day they were mailed out educated mathematicians using science to show statically impossible results in certain areas and multiple abnormalities but I know how much the left hates science when science goes against their opinions weird stuff going down with voting machines If you can t look at the plethora of independent yet corroborating evidence and think something just doesn t add up that s on you However while i think there is enough smoke to make any reasonable individual question the legitimacy of the election I doubt it s enough to push the courts to make a huge move and discredit it on a legal level Trump and his team will have to drop some significant evidence to make that happen ,1

4086,Arghmybrain,From what I understand it s not actually a covid relief bill but a yeartime budget bill or something So this means that it s another bill filled with all kinds of shit that really don t have anything to do with the budget Just like they love to fill every bill with all kinds of bullshit so they can pass evil shit And also means they didn t deem covid 19 an emergency enough to warrant its own bill but had to tack it along something else The suffering people and small businesses don t merit only an afterthought ,1

4097,strawberries6,What s the point in electing another Manchin Seriously why run a Democrat if they re just a Republican anyway Manchin voted for impeachment voted against ACB for the Supreme Court voted to save Obamacare and voted against Trump s tax cuts Now take a look at how the Republican senator for West Virginia voted on those issues See the difference If the Dems had a couple more centrist senators in red states ACB wouldn t be on the Supreme Court for life and Trump s tax cuts wouldn t have passed ,1

4143,VonMouth,Oh yea 100 Trump has a history of racist behaviors against African American people I absolutely believe that race played a factor Why wasn t a lawsuit filed in Madison or Eau Claire two other populous counties that voted blue I would guess it s because they don t have as high a concentration of African American voters Do you NOT think there s racism behind this ,1

4278,try2try,Imagine the boost to the economy if there had been real substantial individual stimulus payments in mid November Desperate people would be slightly less desperate and people who aren t desperate would have been more likely to spend that during the holidays rather than just sticking it in the bank In order to create preserve jobs we need those dollars working in the economy ,1

4310,420blazeit69nubz,Did you make that up ,1
4311,BagofPain,Instead of a stimulus one crazy idea would be to have the fed seize all personal debt from financial institutions for people making less than 100k yr and locking it up for 2 years 0 interest that would be any mortgage student loan secured and unsecured debt as well as mortgages on income property to free up income and personal credit Mandate federal rent control and rental credits across the board Then after 2 years allow for debts to be paid back at a rate of about 4 fixed straight back to the fed with an extremely flexible payback plan up to 50 years Sounds a bit nutty but a little more viable than a once in a while bonus check that will get farted away Plus the government would actually make money in the process ,1
4312,sonofdick,Yeah I ve kinda just given up too ,1
4313,TheSpitRoaster,It s a different axis When Americans say liberals they mean it in regards to cultural norms They prioritize the freedoms of the individual When the rest of the world or at least the Europeans say liberals they mean that on an economic axis They prioritize the freedoms of corpotations and the free flow of trade goods and currency Hence when the ideology of liberalism resurged with some differences it was called neoliberalism My description is quite reductionist obviously ,1
4314,Magick3399,I do understand that racing employs people and requires capital expense but the worker bees in the industry aren t going to get those tax breaks the stable owners and horse owners will If this had been an equal stimulus based on actual need to remain whole rather than preference or vendettas I d be ok with it ,1

4319,Dbrown15,This is nothing more than a political stunt The bar complaint is centered around his support of trump s challenging the election results The Florida bar isn t going to yank his license because some perpetually failed congressional candidate doesn t like Gaetz s politics And because this is Reddit Gaetz is likely universally hated in this sub but this petition is dead on arrival and its idiotic to think otherwise ,1

4334,sebo1715,Yes simply put I do not see the benefit in reading in President elect Biden when there are better ways for the DOD officials to spend their time like assisting DHS and others in purging the intruder from the systems Just like a response would gain to not be overt but done in silence by those very same DOD employees Actually President Trump attempt at redirecting could be constructed as an attempt to foul the Russians into believing that we believes that they are innocent I don t believe that it is Trump intent but someone else might have used that idea Cyberwarfare is about clandestine moves not public declarations ,1
4335,mojave_moon,The Russian government is organized crime that has managed to take over a nation state which uses all means to look after the interests of a very few very wealthy people Russia is the enemy of everyone who fails to support the wealth of these few individuals ,1

4351,Tom_Brokaw_is_a_Punk,IANAL but if no one has officially won the election by January 20th then Trump and Pence s term ends and the next person in the Presidential line of succession Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi becomes President At least in theory because no one has ever just straight up refused to acknowledge an election before ,1
4352,RealitySurge, This is literally what the entire Internet is waiting for A leader who has failed to uphold his single most important designation to protect and serve to be forcibly removed from the White House As much as this can t and shouldn t be allowed to continue the sheer amount of chaos that Trump has inflicted upon the US throughout this pandemic for failing to provide acceptable leadership I think Americans are begging to see this happen ,1
4353,Alorha,In court he s very intentionally avoided arguing the specious fraud claims sticking to issues of Constitutionality Theoretically you could try and make a claim for the ridiculous antics in front of lawn care companies and LARPs in hotels but that s not as easy as if he had gone along with Lin and Syd s crazytown variety lawsuits ,1
4354,Fthewigg,That s why I brought up the personal question I did The folks you defend so strongly are not encouraging you to live that your life A great many would vehemently discourage you from it perhaps even violently How about reinforcing negative sexual stereotypes You cool with that I heard his unemployment dog whistle I wasn t impressed His stance after George Floyd s killing was very telling It s a pity you honestly don t see it Its because you re honestly not looking But hey he s not unemployed right ,1
