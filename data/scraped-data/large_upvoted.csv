235,segvcore,Copy Paste from her Crowd Source the MF odt file with some Reddit comment formatting Initial Statement FAQ s to follow later today Like no I never had a terabyte of data and 750 000 files copied here s why I didn t have a terabyte of storage handy at the time and Most of the 750 000 tally consists of duplicative material Dad made backups and backups and backups On Disk 3 for example were almost 100 backups of the same computer made in relatively close succession You get the gist The actual external disks themselves contain the authenticated files authenticated as in admissible as evidence in courts Those remain in the posession of attorneys for the plaintiffs of Common Cause v Lewis and other cases in NY and MD as the matter of THE Files is still open What you re observing here is my effort to crowd source The Hofeller Files That means that I don t by myself know exactly what We the People should do about our serious problem the government of our country All I can say for certain is that what we re doing now does NOT seem to be working very well The files in this Google Drive were uploaded from my laptop from a folder I named Backups for Gerrymander When you open that folder you find five sub folders Disk 1 Disk 2 Disk 3 Disk 4 and Sticks The extra folder emails is a new creation because on the drives themselves those emails existed as very very very large pst and eml files The backups were unwieldy in size and difficult to upload Also since the folks that have already had a look at this material have found all sorts of interesting stuff in the emails and I wanted y all to be able to see them too I also needed to be able to read everything before I published it don t ya think That s one of the tasks that took so very long But Steph you might say there s so much super personal stuff of YOURS in here why It s because these backups were in large part backups of my parents home computer from a decent number of years back The desktop DID have a folder that I made back in 2012 or 11 called Steph s Stuff I leave all of it in place for the same reason I sent everything to Arnold Porter to preserve the forensic integrity of the material not just for legal but for historical purposes So when it comes to myself I have the right to sacrifice a certain amount of my own privacy Also our ringers of the GOP when they finally figured out that Hofeller s daughter as in my god is that Hofeller s daugher actually had something that embarrassed them they started a campaign to highlight my already public private life and imply that my character or motivation was relevant to the authenticity of the files themselves ie the evidence against them It totally isn t relevant I was not the party that brought my personal life into this matter it was the GOP trying to object to evidence on sole grounds that it was devastating to their case I also leave my shit here so that everyone can see the ridiculousness of the GOP s assertion that these files belong to them No they belong to everybody as they are evidence in matters that concern The People their right to franchise and their access to shared resources And if they belong to any one person that person is me So here I go sharing again I m going to be adding source materials further information research ideas and links to resources In the meantime Mishka and I have been shut up in my apartment for a few days straight now So I m going to go for a ride pick up some ciggies and drop her off at home Please download and distribute this material at will It s yours be nice Yours too for what it s worth Steph,6216

674,Reddit_guard,I m only partway through but I have to say that this piece is phenomenal as a primer for those who have to this point conflated him with his vocal supporters as well as those who think that he will never compromise and as such never get anything done in the face of a more moderate legislation Sanders has always talked about his blue sky political ideals as something he believed in passionately but he separated that idealism from his practical legislative work which was grounded in vote counts He voted for former President Barack Obama s Children s Health Insurance Program reauthorization bill in 2009 and again for the Affordable Care Act in 2010 He voted for the Dodd Frank bill and every other contentious piece of Obama era legislation There are ample cases wherein he has signed on to important legislation despite it not being progressive enough It becomes increasingly hard to say that he won t get anything done when confronted with the evidence that he can indeed compromise when it matters ,2799

855,dad_selfie,I am reading through all of this it s ALOT of documents I will summarize by interview and will update this as I get through it Paul Manafort Interview Manafort and Trump had conversation in which they said Comey was a political partisan Trump thought it was a joke when people said Comey was a Republican and never view him as a Republican Trump thought Comey had made his bed with the Obama administration and was part of the other team He spoke to Hannity who was certainly a back channel but also a personal friend Manafort knew Hannity was speaking to Trump around then because Hannity would tell Manafort to hang in there that he had been talking to Trump that Trump had his back and things like that Manafort understood his conversations with Hannity to be a message from Trump Manafort was aware that Flynn had Turkish and Middle East business connections On a trip to the middle east in April 2017 REDACTED approached Manafort and asked if he was interested in more work in Turkey REDACTED explained part of the work was related to getting a cleric back to Turkey Manafort said he was not interested and asked if the work was associated with Flynn and REDACTED said yes Manafort was later led to believe Flynn REDACTED had done something for REDACTED and the Turkish government Stephen Miller Interview Friday night in Bedminster Miller went to dinner with Trump REDACTED Kushner were there REDACTED Trump started off dinner on Friday night with the topic of Comey s termination REDACTED At the top of the dinner Trump said he wanted to remove Comey and wanted to articulate his reasons in a well honed letter REDACTED Trump already had a great concept for a letter that would be used to fire Comey and make the announcement REDACTED After dinner REDACTED then he went to his room did extensive research to support the letter on his laptop conducted some research took his own best thoughts and Trump s best thought and began the process of putting the letter together REDACTED Interviewers showed Miller a draft of the termination letter with handwritten notes Miller confirmed most of the edits on the letter were in Trump s handwriting The handwriting at the top of page one however was Miller s Miller could not specifically recall the details of the editing process but believed when he met with Trump for breakfast Trump had already made the edits to the letter REDACTED Trump continued to edit the letter REDACTED Trump repeated he did not want the news to leak REDACTED SPECIFIC CONTEXT IN THE TERMINATION LETTER S Trump was explicit the letter should open with a reference to Trump not being under investigation Trump wanted to disqualify the possibility Comey was being removed because Trump was under investigation as it was important for him to establish he was not removing the FBI Director while under investigation Will add more as I go ,275

859,jnkml21,As one who has spent quite a while in government not as long as you I d like to respectfully say that term limits are awful particularly for Congress and slightly less so for Senate I worked in a State where we did institute term limits and it became cheaper and easier to lobby our senators and congress people It simply speeds up the revolving door in politics from being in government to being in private industry lobbying for corporate benefits Even rules which prevent government officials from lobbying are ineffective because we cannot limit the free speech right of people to inform and teach others in corporate organizations how to successfully turn the wheels of those they replace And taking your most successful most re elected individuals and tossing them to private industry is not beneficial Taking experts out of government particularly after they ve built up knowledge around how to get things done and relationships is a bad thing Also in their final terms as we saw in Michigan government after the last election kicked out so many Republicans the brakes were off their corporate greed they were only answerable to the next person who was going to hire them We can t stop people from making a living after we kick them out of office either Simply removing the money from politics is enough Let dedicated public servants answer to the people Edited the first sentence from are a bad thing to are awful for clarity ,256

871,highwirespud,In the last 10 minutes of trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday September 13 someone got very lucky That s when he or she or a group of people sold short 120 000 S amp P e minis electronically traded futures contracts linked to the Standard amp Poor s 500 stock index when the index was trading around 3010 The time was 3 50 p m in New York it was nearing midnight in Tehran A few hours later drones attacked a large swath of Saudi Arabia s oil infrastructure choking off production in the country and sending oil prices soaring By the time the CME next opened for pretrading on Sunday night the S amp P index had fallen 30 points giving that very fortunate trader or traders a quick 180 million profit It was not an isolated occurrence Three days earlier in the last 10 minutes of trading someone bought 82 000 S amp P e minis when the index was trading at 2969 That was nearly 4 a m on September 11 in Beijing where a few hours later the Chinese government announced that it would lift tariffs on a range of American made products As has been the typical reaction in the U S stock markets as the trade war with China chugs on without any perceptible logic when the news about a potential resolution of it seems positive stock markets go up and when the news about the trade war appears negative they go down https www vanityfair com news 2019 10 the mystery of the trump chaos trades,232
872,VeryStableGenius, This was a corporate bailout Exclusively for the richest of farmers Not exclusively but An EWG analysis found that the top one tenth of recipients received 54 percent of all payments Eighty two farmers have each so far received more than 500 000 in trade relief In 2018 payouts to individual farmers hurt by the trade war with China were capped at 125 000 this time the cap has been raised to 250 000 per person or legal entity with a cap of 500 000 Still Schechinger said farmers can get around this easily Chances are it s equal dollars per bushel but farming is concentrated industry ,232
873,PawzUK,If 1 above happens there needs to be zero mercy for the authoritarians who put us in this position Criminal charges against everyone involved with DOJ pushing for the maximum sentence possible Civil forfeiture where possible Jail and bankrupt them Anything else will not sufficiently deter future criminality Yea no more of that healing bullshit ,231
874,ThanksForFlying,My favorite is the zelensky was new we had to make sure we could trust him Like Trump had to personally vet him based on a conversation You re telling me the state department and foreign intelligence agencies didn t know exactly what was going on in Ukrainian election Who the major players are and where the land on the political corruption scale in a country that the US is monitoring due to Russian fuckery Is easy to see bs,228

920,isaac-get-the-golem,In Roberts s framing the threat to democracy issues not from the avarice of would be oligarchs but from the ignorance of ordinary people Civic minded elites like Hamilton Madison and Jay are democracy s champions the irascible mob of common folk its adversaries Self government was not won when ordinary people rose up against the domination of privileged classes but rather when enlightened elites succeeded in convincing the public of the virtues of the principles embodied in the Constitution Thus Roberts s call for revitalizing our democracy does not involve expanding voting rights to marginalized populations let alone reducing disparities in economic power but rather increasing opportunities for citizens to Civic education is certainly important And the capacity of irresponsible political media to manipulate the lay public is a genuine and enduring challenge to popular self government But so is elite contempt for the civic competence of the masses and the oligarchic tyranny that such contempt rationalizes and engenders ,168

930,SpaceAndMolecules,What the unredacted emails do show however is that despite legal concerns expressed by government officials they firmly understood that the directive to withhold the aid came from the top Yup because this was basically known all along the POTUS directed Congressionally approved aid to be withheld until his demands were met He may have written it in magic ink or told people over the phone but everyone knew that this was the directive Remind me how was this impeachment a sham ,163

947,AdventureBum,One of the reasons I m sure Nancy withheld the articles from the Senate for now is so more can be piled on in the meantime should more evidence come out or should Trump break more laws in the meantime I m sure Trump is aware of this as well so it might even be effective at mitigating Trump s behavior between now and the election However it s more likely he ll keep breaking laws anyway He s really got nothing to lose at this point and it s not like having something to lose ever stopped him anyway ,150
948,dy0nisus, there s been a predictable pattern in which efforts by progressive activists to fight racialized violence are met with resistance and bad faith theatrics from conservatives For instance the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement has created a counter movement on the right of arguing that blue lives matter which implies any effort to curtail police killings of black people will somehow make the streets less safe for police Its imperative that people remain cognizant of social narratives in order to help prevent others who are unsuspecting from being caught up in those that disingenuous and manipulative ,149

952,digital_end,I think term limits is something that sounds good on paper and for people who are outraged about politics but in actual practice are very counterproductive A representative has a complicated job It requires teams of people working together and historically first term Representatives get the least amount done It takes time to build relationships and properly understand the system In my opinion attempts to implement term limits are a backdoor way to limit the effectiveness of government as a whole To look at it another way an electrician is a complicated job Why would you send somebody to learn the trade get good at it and then fire them after 8 years Why would you fire a doctor after 8 years regardless of the quality of care they provide It s silly And it belittles the actual complexity and work of these positions Term limits also reduces accountability Why wouldn t a representative abuse their power if they were going to be fired anyway They may as well just sell out to whatever company is offering them a lifetime consulting position and it s not like it s going to hurt their party because the controversy goes with them Instead I would propose better methods for ensuring competitive votes Where people can continue to vote on a representative who is representing them well or have an alternative other than picking someone from the other party even if I hated my representative I m not going to vote for somebody who wants to ban abortion for example That leaves me trapped with my representative A good representative should be able to dedicate their lives to the work if they choose to and they are representing their constituents And our voting system should be designed in a way to ensure bad Representatives can be quickly and effectively removed from office without forcing voters to work against their ideals ,147

1078,BigBennP,You have to understand that Mitch McConnell s fundamental insight about American politics is that much like the average Reddit user the average American voter does not read the article The average American voter does not know nor do they have an interest in learning the details of how procedure in the Senate works They only know that the nomination was held up because that s all the headline told them If they re already Republican they will draw the conclusion that Senate Republicans were rightfully opposing some radical that Obama nominated If they re part of The Middle 40 or so of the country they re more than likely to read the headline and just come to the conclusion that politicians are squabbling and not getting anything done They ll become disenfranchised and are less likely to vote this suits McConnell fine If they re in the 30 or so that are both well informed and liberal McConnell doesn t care what they think To the pr challenge for Democrats is to create headlines that negate this effect,105
1079,merrickgarland2016,To those who think Democrats need to take the high ground now that a 5 4 purely partisan Republican Supreme Court majority has made extreme partisan gerrymandering the law of the land you might want to do anything you can legally under Republican rules to keep these types out of office ,105

1146,i__cant__even__,This is what I keep pointing to when his supporters say which law did he break The Act specifies that the President May request that Congress rescind appropriated funds If both the Senate and the House of Representatives have not approved a rescission proposal by passing legislation within 45 days of continuous session any funds being withheld must be made available for obligation Congress is not required to vote on the request and has ignored most Presidential requests Everyone spouting off about how the president has full authority direct foreign policy is conveniently ignoring the fact that the president does not have authority to rescind funds already appropriated He literally has to ask Congress permission and Congress is under no obligation to even respond to his request ,62
1147,Iohet,The House wouldn t be in Democratic hands without the Harley Rouda s of the world getting elected in Republican leaning districts Local politics are different than national politics As long as you can execute your party platform on the whole having moderates or those to the right or left of your party platform in the tent is acceptable ,62
1148,Nextlevelregret,I ve really liked Yang s inclusion in the race and hope he runs again we need to be talking about AI and automation and UBI at this level But this shit right here is why he can go jump America is broken and it undermines his message if he doesn t want to fix the elements corruption that drive the problems that he talks about wanting to fix income inequality ,62

1166,johnny_soultrane,Anyone else notice how we give all this attention to centrists prior to an election but once the election is over somehow the centrists escape critical analysis for their votes We blame literally anything else after the fact meddling voter purges ballot fuckery voter suppression low turnout etc Never do we point to the enlightened centrists who s whims we were all obsessed with prior to the election These are not intelligent people these centrists They are the opposite of enlightened ,53

1176,dismayedcitizen,Because the justice department is obstructing justice ,51
1177,allsortsashit,Those reasons were because our president has a longstanding record of trying to root out corruption It s all about how much he is trying to fix a corrupted system and has a longstanding track record of doing exactly that Also he has worked since before he was president on those durn adoptions Adoptions is very important to him too and he continues to work on that s,51
1178,Mike_Huncho,He was acquitted because his team s medic was offered immunity to testify and he told the court that he actually killed the dude out of mercy after Gallagher stabbed him multiple times and left his victims to bleed out Make no mistake Eddie Gallagher is pure trash that deserves to be incarcerated for his crimes Why do you hate America so much that you feel compelled to actively spread propaganda from our countries enemies ,51

1183,DrDerpberg,Ive said before that its a shame that the field is actually too qualified because that means a lot of great potential candidates get left behind Castro and booker both seem like qualified solid candidates but they simply dont have the recognition to win The good news is that the cupboard is stocked for the future I see no reason Booker or Castro won t still be strong candidates every nomination for the next 10 years ,49
1184,MDesnivic,I still today remember the bewildering feeling I had when Trump first started running back in 2015 just hearing his speeches I remember repeatedly asking myself in my head Who the fuck talks like that Like this is all a joke right Surely the only people who could actually stand to listen to him are exclusively just angry morons Suddenly people right wing of course but reasonable or respectable in one degree or another began not only taking him seriously but praising him as this triumphant God send I couldn t believe my eyes or ears This man is the hill you want to die on Was half the country in on some joke the other half wasn t It still hits me occasionally I keep wondering how anyone can hear this man speak at a rally without staring deep into the abyss as a very witty writer once put it What does any supporter truly see in this man Honor Grace Wisdom Basic decency In the end to me he remains an enigma I m truly fascinated by both him and his supporters How does a person just have nothing but flaws No human is perfect but how can a man be so perfectly imperfect How does someone lack a single even semi decent quality On what planet is this man God s chosen one I didn t understand it then and I don t understand it now ,49
1185,Swooshz56,Yep thats exactly what they re going to say Just like when Sondland knew exactly that Trump wanted Ukraine s dirt in exchange But how do you know Did he text it to you Give anything in writing No Then how is that clear direction How did you know that he didn t mean anything else Nothing will be good enough to change their minds here ,49
1186,skushi08,Agree Beto the senate candidate was a good bit different I was a huge supporter at the state level here but once he moved on to the national stage for some reason he didn t feel genuine anymore When he first announced his candidacy I assumed he was running for VP which might still be his end goal Early on a Biden Beto ticket seemed like something the DNC would have loved ,49

1189,Wund3rBoi,They supported his campaign because he was running against Hillary not because they like him or think they can exploit him With Trump in the White House they will definitely make efforts to smear his campaign especially if he wins the nomination ,48
1190,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,One of the guys who spoke to investigators and encouraged others to come forward is now a sniper on SEAL Team 6 Allegedly the most elite squad in the SEAL community Do you really think they d recruit a guy who lied about a fellow SEAL because of some personal vendetta Or a guy that wasn t tough enough under this war criminal The medic completely changed his testimony once he received immunity as well ,48
1191,CawoodsRadio,Lol this is their excuse Their actual reasoning is that they just don t care He is their guy and nothing he has done or will do can change that Still you re correct this excuse will be what they continue to yell about ,48

1210,Haltopen, Needless to say none of this captures the depths of depravity on display in Gallagher s brightly lit Instagram pictures which include an image of a custom made hatchet he told the maker he hoped he could use on someone s skull What the actual Fuck,45
1211,caringcaribou,Well its technically no more devastating than all the other evidence we ve already seen Certainly it is devastating in the sense that it is yet more proof that Trump directly ordered the hold didnt offer a legitimate reason for doing so and the executive branch agencies involved were aware that their actions were in contravention of the law ,45

1217,moonbeanie,Washinon State republicans have more or less removed him from positions of power but they aren t going to ditch him To them his only crime is getting caught He s a fucking terrorist for God s sake who used his leverage with the police to learn of their plans and tactics then took them to armed insurgents like the Bundys so that they could use them for planning purposes He has written a treatise about starting biblical war and killing all non converted males he runs a Jesus camp teaching kids how to kill other people for Christ and yet there he is still a Washinon State republican As a Washinonian I m angered and appalled by all of this ,44
1218,dokimasia,I agree it is everywhere Media narratives and disinformation campaigns are shaping our views of the candidates It s already been happening to Warren and Bernie Basically whoever challenges the status quo about how our government and economy operates is likely to be targeted ,43

1221,IJustLoggedInToSay-,Apt quotation FTA This is not the story of American conservatives being a bit kooky in their understanding of patriotism This is a story of how right wing propaganda is converting American conservatism into a fascist movement ,43
1222,Egorse, The House Judiciary Committee will contend Friday in court that it still needs information quickly from former Special Counsel Robert S Mueller III s investigation even though the House impeached President Donald Trump last month When you consider that the impeachment was not about the Mueller report it makes sense they still want to pursue the information they ve been asking that pertain to the Mueller report without the impeachment changing that ,43
1223,strolpol,The women who can t get abortions and die of ectopic pregnancies and other complications would strongly disagree about it not being life or death ,43

1229,Tripleberst,Apparently this doesn t mean that Yang or anyone else can t qualify they just haven t yet ,42
1230,PLZ-PM-ME-DAD-JOKES, This is a story of how right wing propaganda is converting American conservatism into a fascist movement It s doubtful that Trump who has called Gallagher one of the ultimate fighters and invited him to party at Mar a Lago or Gallagher s other right wing fans actually imagine that he is innocent of the charges against him I don t think they believe that the seven SEALs who testified against Gallagher at great personal risk are lying Rather Gallagher is being lionized because of what he allegedly did in Afghanistan This is about the American right embracing racialized violence against people they hate in this case Muslims It s about American conservatives adopting a fascist narrative of the redemptive cleansing power of violence ,42
1231,UCantBahnMi,Damn right,42
1232,Trippy_trip27,Jailed people who shared sensitive information What s wrong with that And if he did abuse it where is the proof And fo with those non profits There is no way Obama had influence in the IRS or that they were targeting them only for being conservative ,42

1234,RadBadTad,In a vacuum without the audience of the left the right wouldn t care about Gallagher But they know that it upsets us to see them worship him and so it s fun for them The right has proven that they will support and celebrate literally anything so long as the left doesn t like it ,41
1235,shimslady74,Am I the only one who cringes at the fact that we are now at a place in time where the amount of money raised is the paramount indicator of a candidates viability We have to fix this folks For what it s worth Biden is not my guy ,41

1434,Heimerdahl,Uff The second one is a bit questionable as it s an opinion piece and I can t bother to check it s validity but the first one coming from herself is pretty damning Combined with saying all the things Reddit wants to hear and the whole First Clean Election thing which sounds a bit fishy this doesn t look as good as it seems ,38
1435,geoffp82,And that the DOJ willfully redacted the most incriminating parts of the emails demonstrating they knew what they were doing was illegal ,38

1443,AtheoSaint,Plus it s a lot easier for a handful of billionaires who most likely have similar backgrounds and currently have similar class interests to come to a decision and act on it than hundreds of millions of people to do the same It emphasizes the importance of raising class consciousness among the working class and thankfully we re already seeing that happen around America and parts of the world so that s hopeful ,37

1460,jlwtrb,The minimum wage would be 21 if it kept up with worker productivity over the last 50 years For those concerned that raising the minimum wage could lead to job loss the fact that corporations collectively make trillions in profit means they can afford to pay trillions more in wages We re no where near the minimum wage level that would lead to higher unemployment But as we develop new technology we re able to produce much more in less time but the only people who have benefited are the owners of capital This will only get exponentially worse with automation which is something minimum wage won t solve That s why we need to move away from private ownership of corporations and toward worker and public ownership Automation and increased productivity should mean everyone has to work less to get more not that everyone has stagnating wages if they re lucky enough to have a job while the owners of capital add to their billions,35

1463,Kalepsis,Trump committed three distinct crimes in this whole Ukraine episode Withholding funds allocated by Congress without a valid legal reason soliciting assistance from a foreign government to sabotage an American election and extortion of a foreign leader to motivate that assistance The evidence is clear Every Republican Senator who votes to acquit him is effectively publicly defending a criminal enemy of the United States Constitution and the rule of law Get him out then get them out I refuse to allow the US to become the Fourth Reich ,34
1464,Goldensarethebest,They start the brainwashing young ,34

1470,scarr3g,And yet millions saw this misbegotten homunculus and decided this was the champion they d been longing for all this time That may be because they were tired of having someone smarter than them being in charge making them feel small By electing Trump they can feel better about themselves because they might actually be smarter than the president for once ,33

1473,crusty_cum-sock,I saw over in the AskTurnipSupporters thread the other day when this came up that they were saying none of the blame should go to the businesses hiring illegals because businesses are inherently greedy so it s to be expected They didn t take into account that illegal immigration is also to be expected when people are literally running to save their and their family s lives and also these job opportunities further incentivize illegal immigration But nope 100 of the problem is the the undocumented immigrants and 0 of the problem is businesses hiring undocumented immigrants ,32

1937,weaponized_urine, Patriotism is when love of your own people comes first nationalism when hate for people other than your own comes first Charles de Gaulle E additional distinction from Merrimack Webster One of the many difficulties inherent in creating a dictionary that accurately reflects the language of any large group of people is that these people may not all view certain words and values as equal Nationalism and patriotism present us with an appropriately problematic pair with which to illustrate this Are these words synonymous Is one an insult and the other not Can either of them mean different things to different people Patriotism is the older of the two words with published written evidence dating back to the middle of the 17th century Patriotism came from adding the suffix of ism to the existing word patriot which itself came into English from the French patriote and may be traced back further to the Greek word patrios of one s father There is hardly any judicious man but knoweth that it was neither learning piety nor patriotism that perswaded any of that Nation to Presbytery C N Reasons Why the Supreme Authority of the Three Nations for the time is not in the Parliament 1653 There hath been in London and repairing to it for these many yeers together a knot of Scotish bankers collybists or coinecoursers of traffickers in Merchandise to and againe and of men of other professions who hug all unto themselves that for no respect of vertue honor kinred patriotism or whatever else whereof those quomodocunquizing clusterfists and rapacious varlets have given of late such cannibal like proofs by their inhumanity and obdurate carriage towards some whose shoos strings they are not worthy to unty that were it not that a more able pen then mine will assuredly not faile to jerk them on all sides Thomas Urquhart Ekskybalauron 1652 Quick side note the Urquhart citation above serves two purposes being both our earliest written evidence of the word patriotism and a fine excuse for drawing the reader s attention to the beautifully splenetic turn of phrase quomodocunquizing clusterfists These two words are archaic enough to only be defined in the Oxford English Dictionary which informs us that the former is that makes money in any possible way and the latter is a close fisted or grasping fellow Should you ever find yourself in need of an insult that is not hackneyed and stale we wholeheartedly recommend quomodocunquizing clusterfist End of side note We do not have any evidence of nationalism occurring until just before the 19th century almost a hundred and fifty years after patriotism And in its early use from the end of the 18th century onward for a number of decades nationalism appears to have been largely interchangeable with patriotism with both words primarily being used to refer to a general love of one s country Nationalism must involve the consecrated devotion of a responsive citizenship sound policies must have universal faith and unsound vagaries must have universal condemnation The Marion County News Hamilton AL 1 Jan 1820 Modern France instead of diminishing has if possible encreased this nationalism Removed from his oppression and atrocities they see nothing but the magnificence the success and the splendor of Bonaparte and I assure you that every poor ignorant stupid Creole when he hears of an achievement of this their Demi God evinces a lively interest an exultation as if some choice unlooked for gift of heaven had blessed his family Poulson s American Daily Advertiser Philadelphia PA 11 Oct 1811 If there be not Conservatism and Nationalism and Patriotism enough in the North to rise up and overwhelm with numbers the spirit that points to the the election of anybody but Fremont or of Fremont as the prelude to civil war we had better seek to save as much fratricidal blood as possible in a peaceable line of immediate separation New York Daily News 1 Jul 1856 These two words may have shared a distinct sense in the 19th century but they appear to have grown apart since Or rather it would be more accurate to say that only nationalism has grown apart since the meaning of patriotism has remained largely unchanged There are still obvious areas of overlap we define patriotism as love for or devotion to one s country and nationalism in part as loyalty and devotion to a nation But the definition of nationalism also includes exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or supranational groups This exclusionary aspect is not shared by patriotism A somewhat subtler difference between the two words may be found in their modifiers and the ideas to which each is connected When we examine large bodies of recent text we see that patriotism is more often used in a general sense often in conjunction with such words as bravery valor duty and devotion Nationalism however tends to find itself modified by specific movements most frequently of a political bent ,29

1939,skkITer,Well the first thing is that Trump is required to inform Congress whenever he withholds or pauses aid that was previously approved by Congress That s wrong Second we have our own resources and law enforcement who handle the investigation of our citizens overseas Asking a foreign government to announce investigations into one of our citizens is wrong Announcing an investigation also is wrong that s not how things work Third no Ukrainians knew the aid was withheld and no US officials told them anything about corruption So how the fuck are they supposed to know they need to work on corruption to get the aid ,29

1941,burnbabyburn711,Manipulating videos like this is a great tactic for unscrupulous political operatives because Americans are lazy and ignorant It will definitely leave a residue on Biden no matter how many legitimate news sources debunk it or how thoroughly they do so A non trivial percentage of voters will remember seeing the video and will either not have seen or not believe the reporting exposing it as dishonest We are in the shape we re in because too many Americans are awful ,29
1942,caringcaribou,A it is evidence that the order to hold the aid came directly from Trump This point has been in the past denied by Trump defenders who would like to give him plausible deniability B It is proof that Trump withheld the aid without a legal basis It is also proof that OMB and Pentagon officials were aware that there was no legal basis to withhold the aid and were concerned about the complications that would arise from illegally withholding congressionally appropriated funds A key part of any corruption criminal case is demonstrating culpability C It is proof that the administration has misused redactions and withheld documents in order to conceal politically legally damaging information associated with the scandal There is literally no national security interest or any other explanation to justify redacting these details this is a blatant coverup D Taken in the context of testimony we ve heard from OMB State Department NSA and White House staff these internal emails from OMB and Pentagon contribute to an extremely consistent body of evidence Trump leveraged US foreign policy to secure political favours in the form of sham investigations of his political rivals and then he coordinated efforts with the DOJ OMB and State Department to engage in a coverup E It also shows the extent to which brainwashed bozos will ignore facts and evidence in favour of their own partisan preference Would you believe there are still idiots out there who can t wrap their minds around what Trump did and why he poses a massive threat to the US constitution ,29
1943,R_TOKAR,Veteran here I agree with you 100 But I think what well I hope what they are saying is that this kid is enlisting for the wrong reasons Not for duty of country but duty of a cult If that makes sense And that is scary shit we don t need ppl like that to enlist ,28

1948,hellomondays,This is what this blogger is upset about In 2015 Warren introduced legislation that would penalize drug companies that break the law and force them to invest in research to compensate Americans In a statement touting the legislation Warren said that it was time to repeal the medical device tax with an appropriate offset so Massachusetts device companies can continue to innovate and save lives So basically once again Jacobin fails to realize that you can have ideals stick to those ideals and still be pragmatic enough to actually make change Notice they will not write a piece about all the pro Fraternal Order of Police or gun industry legislation Bernie pushed or his votes against Meghan s law legislation I see them as less of a pro left blog and more of a pro cult of personality blog around one politician ,28

1964,Saiing,Other people are being quick to point it out because they re cheap point scorers who who are only interested in playing to the carnival of fools that exist on sites like this He made some comments on Warren s wealth tax which neither directly attacked its intentions it or said he wouldn t pay it They were taken way out of context and reported on propaganda sites like reddit as nothing like what he actually said or meant Have you actually read or watched his interview I doubt it or you wouldn t be throwing out this kind of rhetoric He was responding to a question put to him about paying 100 billion in tax which was a stupid point and joked about the fact that he d probably have nothing left It was intended to be a lighthearted quip and was essentially true given that at the time of the interview his net worth was hovering around 100 billion I m sorry to direct this at you because it s a far more widespread problem than just yourself but one of the reasons we get the politicians we deserve is exactly because of your mindset where you ve created an entrenched view of the world based not on fact but on what you ve decided you want to believe Gates has been calling for the rich to pay more tax for years He s consistently been one of the main advocates of such a change He s also done more good with his money than almost anyone else on the planet Sure he may not be perfect but neither are you or I ,26

2040,JFRHorton, The AWB doesn t affect the most commonly used firearms in mass shootings Mass shootings do not strongly correlate to lax or strong firearms policies but generally other social factors The majority of mass shootings occur with illegally acquired firearms Defensive Gun Uses yearly far outnumber the cases of unjustifiable homicide Mass shootings while shocking are basically just background noise when it comes to yearly deaths Firearms ownership is a constitutionally protected individual right The firearms you want to ban have been common in this nation for almost 100 years now but mass shootings are a fairly recent phenomenon To me that points to another root cause ,8

2050,lizbrarian,I got one of these notifications after I moved to a different neighborhood in Milwaukee and naively thought it was in good faith a reminder for me to re register If all these voters are purged it is absolutely going to be a big problem when they try to vote Wisconsin has same day registration which is great but you have to both know that you need to register AND you need to bring something with you that can verify your address I spent years working at a public library in Milwaukee working with the general public and most of the people I interacted with will not be prepared for this at all should they find that they ve been purged from the voter rolls The first time I tried to vote in Milwaukee in 2012 I thought I had what I needed but I was wrong and I had to run back home and then back to the polling site with the correct documentation And I m generally on top of this stuff Most people likely are not and we should be making it easier not harder for them to vote ,7

2058,MJURICAN,A free market is fundamentally incapable of fixing the climate due to the exact same reasons it caused it in the first place This is not just rhetoric from me either its been empirically proven Look up prosperity without growth its a book thats based on a UK government study Quite accesible for non economists In short if you happen to be economically educated above bachelor level its been empirically proven that a free market economy simply cant absolutely decouple from enviromentally damaging externalities The best it can do is continously relatively decouple but even that its doing at to slow a speed to even notably slow the harm to the climate The one thing all economists agree with is that a 100 carbon taxation scheme is needed to allow for the market to account for its hidden externalities But now the consensus is moving to even that being too little too late We are quickly reaching the point where of simply just cutting economic activity as in completely shut down industries will be necessary to keep our climate livable and our civilization alive Genuinely go look at prosperity without growth start with the chapter on decoupling if you re uninterested in the rest Here s a review to get you started https www theguardian com books 2010 jan 23 properity without growth tim jackson And here s the original study http www sd commission org uk data files publications prosperity_without_growth_report pdf,6

2079,MazzIsNoMore,I agree with everything you said The House of Representatives is essentially a parliamentary system even though almost everyone is in one of the two parties You can see the factions very clearly in the Democratic party The real issue is that equal representation fails in the Senate and the electoral college A party can win the presidency and hold the Senate with a severe deficit in vote totals Presidents being elected while losing the popular vote by millions should never happen Republicans having a majority of the Senate while Democrats had a vote total of over 10 more of the total vote count should not be the norm More parties will not fix this when the problem is that people s votes aren t determining who controls the government ,5

2111,lonestar-rasbryjamco,That is the point however The reason Republicans are not asked this is because it doesn t matter for them to win elections The far right coalition is large enough that they can dictate primaries and the rest of the republican party falls in line This doesn t happen in the Democratic party because it is a much more fractured and diverse political coalition ,3

2119,orangefly, Congress is already supposed to be proportional representation It s not Republicans can cry about mob rule all they want but between the EC the Senate the cap on the House and the crazy amount of republican gerrymandering the american people have to outvote republicans 3 or 4 to 1 just to get an equal say in how our government is run Something needs to change Our system of government is broken ,3
2120,lennybird,We need to establish a few things 1 Money correlates to speech which correlates to better odds of winning Pointing to exceptions does not change the point being made and the videos I linked regarding money and political influence suggest this 2 There is a natural understanding that Republicans are the Party of Business wherein any corporate lobbyist will desire for Republicans to get in office to gut regulations and expand upon their profit margins without having to deal with regulatory overhead essentially restricting the nuclear reaction via control rods 3 In the era of diminished Union strenh which always had a tendency to benefit Democrats and an increase in Corporate Big Business strenh over the years massive rise in inequality soaring corporate profits and influence of money in politics such corporations have the means to widen their influence on BOTH parties but ultimately preferring Republicans In the wake of SpeechNow v FEC and Citizens United decisions the inherent power of these corporate voices rise and therefore so do Republicans It s why a Conservative organization pushed for this and it s why Democrats opposed it This all leads to my final point which you skipped over in my post In the past when I ve posted this I ve seen a pattern of responses who are trying to highlight that Democrats utilize SuperPAC money Dark Money etc and claim it s equal or more than Republicans That may or may not be true Here s the key point that supersedes that argument Only the Democrats have made a concerted effort to destroy the entire process Republicans widely have not and in fact only widened the speech inequality I m not trying to be partisan in saying this that s just a fact So ask yourself If a Democrats are indeed benefiting more or equally from this process why would they undermine their own advantage unless they cared about fixing the system If b Republicans have the advantage then Democrats are still correct to remove this disproportionate advantage which undermines the average citizens voice I repeat If Democrats stand to benefit why are they the only ones advocating for changing the rules of the corrupt game Ask yourself that ,3

2144,Edazarehehcs,No one s saying systemic racism isn t a thing But the solution isn t risk throwing away entire elections to artificially prop up POC candidates who are polling like shit The root of the problem is incumbency and lack of term limits Our Senate is currently the oldest it s ever been average age of 62 years of course they re going to be behind the times We need to address that problem rather than give into tokenism and lose elections because we re ignoring candidates who can win ,2

2372,PaperbackWriter66,You can t have it both ways Either the Militia Clause is meaningless in which case military type weapons are not especially protected or the 2nd Amendment is indeed about ensuring we continue to have an effective militia in which case the right of ordinary people to possess military arms suitable to defending this country is inalienable FWIW here s what Scalia said in Heller about this point It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service M 16 rifles and the like may be banned then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause But as we have said the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty It may well be true today that a militia to be as effective as militias in the 18th century would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large Indeed it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modern day bombers and tanks But the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right ,1
