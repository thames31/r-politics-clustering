8,hildebrand_rarity, For the chairman of the Senate committee charged with oversight of our legal system to have reportedly suggested that an election official toss out large numbers of legal ballots from American voters is appalling says Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washinon Executive Director Noah Bookbinder Not only is it wrong for Sen Graham to apparently contemplate illegal behavior but his suggestion undermines the integrity of our elections and the faith of the American people in our democracy He alleges Under the guise of rooting out election fraud it looks like Graham is suggesting committing it That is unacceptable and Sen Graham should step down from his chairmanship immediately Hey Republicans I found the real voter fraud right here ,12792
